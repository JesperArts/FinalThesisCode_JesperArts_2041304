Master’s Thesis Data Science in Business & Entrepreneurship
Jheronimous Academy of Data Science

This repository contains the data, code, and replication materials for my Master’s thesis examining the relationship between Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) adoption and firm performance, with a particular focus on the moderating role of Dynamic Capabilities and industry heterogeneity.

The thesis employs a text-based measurement approach using corporate disclosures and estimates fixed-effects panel regression models on firm–year–quarter data covering the period 2018–2025.
